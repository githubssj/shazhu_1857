2. Generate Fuquan info from sina web page
3. calulate amplitude of an stock or an block of stock in an region with Fuqian info
==TODO==
this is my first program to calculate stock static, so the logic is not clear.
And this kind of language is not very powerful to this kind of job.
After use the pragram for some days, I found it is hard to add more function, reason maybe python itself or my personal logic
So I tried to Function Programming language, the result is in https://github.com/myrual/1857
It is clear and short and easy to add more feature.
